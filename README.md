# rock-paper-scissors (index.html)
Learned the following in javascript:
Loops, conditional statements
Methods: prompt (as well as storing the value gathered with it), alert, 	Math.random+math.floor
Learned how to create my own functions.
All while using all of them in useful way, thus creating a little game of rock-paper-scissors.

Update:
Created a simple through javascript, with inline CSS elements, and addEventListeners.
Used nested conditions.
